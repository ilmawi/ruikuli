# ruikuli
co2.yaml is for homeassistant + esphome + esm32-c3-supermini + ens160+aht21 

On esp32 use top right pins for 5v power (5v and G) and left side use second and third for data (next to the red led). Second pin on esp goes to the sda on sensor and third pin goes to scl.
on sensor stick 5v cable to VN and G to G.
